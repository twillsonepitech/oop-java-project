First main call database class
        -> It will call loadFromFile method to load stored data from a JSON file
        -> At the end of the program, when exiting, it will call saveToFile method, to store new data in a JSON file
        (both method share the same file)

Main will create Store object to store clients, vehicles

Database is calling Client class to create a List of clients

Store class is also calling Client class to manipulate Clients




Vehicle abstract class, that will implements Purchasable interface
        (Vehicle has protected attributes)

Car and Motorcycle class extends from Vehicle
        (so we have access to the purchase method inside the interface)

Difference between Car class and Motorcycle class is that Car class has numberOfDoors as private attribute,
        whereas Motorcycle class has type as private attribute

And basically, they both have purchase method, to tell the User which Vehicle he purchased
